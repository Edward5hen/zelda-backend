# cvp-backend
Zelda is a web-based tool developed by Atomic QE team to simplify QE's daily work. Beautifully displaying our test results with charts is an important part of it. It is designed as separating front and back ends. The back end provides REST APIs to CRUD the test resources, while the front end is a web client to display and operate them.
